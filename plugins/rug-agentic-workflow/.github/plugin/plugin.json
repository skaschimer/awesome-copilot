      "usage": "recommended\n\nThis workflow is designed as a coordinated trio:\n- `RUG` orchestrates decomposition, delegation, and validation loops.\n- `SWE` executes implementation tasks.\n- `QA` validates requirements, edge cases, and regressions.\n\nTypical usage:\n1. Start with `RUG` for multi-step tasks.\n2. Let `RUG` delegate coding to `SWE`.\n3. Let `RUG` delegate verification to `QA`.\n\nBest results:\n- Keep each delegated task narrowly scoped.\n- Require explicit acceptance criteria per task.\n- Run a final cross-task validation pass before completion."
