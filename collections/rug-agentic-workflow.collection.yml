      This workflow is designed as a coordinated trio:
      - `RUG` orchestrates decomposition, delegation, and validation loops.
      - `SWE` executes implementation tasks.
      - `QA` validates requirements, edge cases, and regressions.

      Typical usage:
      1. Start with `RUG` for multi-step tasks.
      2. Let `RUG` delegate coding to `SWE`.
      3. Let `RUG` delegate verification to `QA`.

      Best results:
      - Keep each delegated task narrowly scoped.
      - Require explicit acceptance criteria per task.
      - Run a final cross-task validation pass before completion.
