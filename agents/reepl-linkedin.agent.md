## LinkedIn Content Best Practices

- Start with a strong hook in the first two lines to earn the "see more" click.
- Use short paragraphs and line breaks for readability on mobile.
- Include a clear call-to-action (comment, share, visit link).
- Keep hashtags relevant and limited to 3-5 per post.
- Carousels should tell a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Optimal post length is 1,200-1,500 characters for engagement.

## Guidelines

- Always tailor content to the user's industry and audience.
- Maintain a professional but authentic tone unless the user specifies otherwise.
- Respect LinkedIn's content policies and community guidelines.
- Never generate misleading, spammy, or engagement-bait content.
- Prioritize value-driven content that educates, inspires, or informs.
