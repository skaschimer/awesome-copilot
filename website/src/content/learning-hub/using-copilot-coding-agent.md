The Copilot coding agent is an autonomous agent that can work on GitHub issues without continuous human guidance. You assign it an issue, it spins up a cloud environment, writes code, runs tests, and opens a pull request—all while you focus on other work. Think of it as a junior developer who never sleeps, handles the well-defined tasks, and always asks for review.

This article explains how the coding agent works, how to set it up, and best practices for getting the most out of autonomous coding sessions.

## How It Works

The coding agent follows a straightforward workflow:

```
1. You assign an issue to Copilot (or @mention it)
         ↓
2. Copilot spins up a cloud dev environment
         ↓
3. It reads the issue, your instructions, and codebase
         ↓
4. It plans and implements a solution
         ↓
5. It runs tests and validates the changes
         ↓
6. It opens a pull request for your review
```

The agent works in its own branch, in an isolated environment. It can't merge code or deploy—it always produces a PR that a human must review and approve.

**Key characteristics**:
- Runs in a secure, sandboxed cloud environment
- Uses your repository's instructions, agents, and skills for context
- Executes hooks (linting, formatting) automatically
- Creates a PR with a summary of what it did and why
- Supports iterating—you can comment on the PR and the agent will refine

## Setting Up the Environment

The coding agent needs to know how to set up your project. Define this in `.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml`:

```yaml
# .github/copilot-setup-steps.yml
steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm ci

  - name: Build the project
    run: npm run build

  - name: Verify tests pass
    run: npm test
```

### What to Include

Think of this file as bootstrapping instructions for a new developer joining the project:

**Language runtimes**: If your project needs a specific Node.js, Python, or Go version, install it here.

**Dependencies**: Install all project dependencies (`npm ci`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `bundle install`).

**Build step**: Compile the project if needed, so the agent can verify its changes build successfully.

**Test command**: Run the test suite so the agent can validate its changes don't break existing functionality.

**Example for a Python project**:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Set up Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v5
    with:
      python-version: '3.12'

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: pip install -r requirements.txt

  - name: Run tests
    run: pytest
```

**Example for a multi-language project**:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install Node.js dependencies
    run: npm ci

  - name: Install Python dependencies
    run: pip install -r requirements.txt

  - name: Build frontend
    run: npm run build

  - name: Run all tests
    run: npm test && pytest
```

## Assigning Work to the Coding Agent

There are several ways to trigger the coding agent:

### From a GitHub Issue

1. Create a well-described issue with clear acceptance criteria
2. Assign the issue to **Copilot** (it appears as an assignee option)
3. The agent starts working within minutes

### From a Comment

On any issue, comment:
```
@copilot work on this
```

Or provide more specific direction:
```
@copilot implement the user avatar upload feature described above.
Use the existing FileUpload component and S3 service.
```

### Using Custom Agents

Custom agents let you give the coding agent a specialized persona, toolset, and instructions for specific types of work. Instead of relying on generic behavior, you can point the coding agent at an agent profile tailored for your task.

**Where custom agents live**: Agent profiles are stored as `.agent.md` files in `.github/agents/` in your repository. For organization-wide agents, place them in the root `agents/` directory.

```
.github/
└── agents/
    ├── api-architect.agent.md
    ├── test-specialist.agent.md
    └── security-reviewer.agent.md
```

**Selecting an agent on GitHub.com**: When prompting the coding agent or assigning it to an issue, use the dropdown menu in the agents panel to select your custom agent instead of the default.

**Selecting an agent via comment**: On any issue, mention the agent by name:

```
@copilot use the api-architect agent to implement this API endpoint
```

The agent will adopt the persona, tools, and guardrails defined in that agent file.

**What goes in an agent profile**: An `.agent.md` file is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter defining the agent's name, description, available tools, and optionally MCP server configurations. The Markdown body contains the agent's behavioral instructions (up to 30,000 characters).

```markdown
---
name: test-specialist
description: Focuses on test coverage, quality, and testing best practices
tools: ["read", "edit", "search", "bash"]
---

You are a testing specialist. Analyze existing tests, identify coverage gaps,
and write comprehensive unit and integration tests. Follow best practices for
the language and framework. Never modify production code unless asked.
```

> **Tip**: Browse the [Agents Directory](/agents/) on this site for ready-to-use agent profiles you can add to your repository.

## Writing Effective Issues for the Coding Agent

The coding agent is only as good as the issue it receives. Well-structured issues lead to better results.

### Good Issue Structure

```markdown
## Summary
Add a rate limiter to the /api/login endpoint to prevent brute force attacks.

## Requirements
- Limit to 5 attempts per IP address per 15-minute window
- Return HTTP 429 with a Retry-After header when limit is exceeded
- Use the existing Redis cache for rate tracking
- Log rate limit violations to our security audit log

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limiter middleware is applied to POST /api/login
- [ ] Tests cover: normal login, rate limit hit, rate limit reset
- [ ] Existing login tests continue to pass

## Context
- Rate limiter utility exists at src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts
- Redis client is configured in src/config/redis.ts
- Security audit logger is at src/utils/security-logger.ts
```

### Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: "Add input validation" is vague. "Validate email format and password length (8+ chars) on the registration endpoint" is actionable.
- **Point to existing code**: Reference files, utilities, and patterns the agent should use.
- **Define done**: List acceptance criteria or test cases that verify the work is complete.
- **Scope appropriately**: Single-feature issues work best. Break large features into smaller issues.
- **Include constraints**: If there are things the agent should NOT do ("don't modify the database schema"), say so explicitly.

## Working with the Pull Request

When the coding agent finishes, it opens a PR with:

- A description of changes and the reasoning behind them
- File-by-file summaries of what changed
- References back to the original issue

### Reviewing the PR

Review coding agent PRs like any other:

1. **Read the summary**: Understand what the agent did and why
2. **Check the diff**: Verify the implementation matches your expectations
3. **Run tests locally**: Confirm tests pass in your environment
4. **Leave comments**: If something needs to change, comment on the PR

### Iterating with Comments

If the PR needs adjustments, comment directly:

```
@copilot the rate limiter should use a sliding window, not a fixed window.
Also, add a test for the Retry-After header value.
```

The agent will read your feedback, make changes, and push new commits to the same PR.

## Agent Skills and the Coding Agent

Agent skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that the coding agent can automatically load when relevant to a task. While custom agents define _who_ does the work, skills define _how_ to do specific types of work.

### How Skills Work with the Coding Agent

When the coding agent works on a task, it reads the `description` field in each skill's `SKILL.md` and decides whether that skill is relevant. If so, the skill's instructions are injected into the agent's context — giving it access to specialized guidance, scripts, and examples without you needing to specify anything.

This means you can add skills to your repository and the coding agent will **automatically** leverage them when appropriate.

### Where Skills Live

Skills are stored in a `skills/` subdirectory, with each skill in its own folder:

**Project skills** (specific to one repository):
```
.github/
└── skills/
    ├── github-actions-debugging/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    ├── database-migrations/
    │   ├── SKILL.md
    │   └── scripts/
    │       └── migrate.sh
    └── api-testing/
        ├── SKILL.md
        └── references/
            └── test-template.ts
```

**Personal skills** (shared across all your projects):
```
~/.copilot/
└── skills/
    └── code-review-checklist/
        └── SKILL.md
```

### What Makes Skills Powerful

Unlike simple instructions, skills can bundle additional resources:

- **Scripts** that the agent can execute (e.g., a migration script, a code generator)
- **Templates** and examples the agent can reference
- **Data files** and reference material for specialized domains
- **Supplementary Markdown** files with detailed guidance

The `SKILL.md` file tells the agent when and how to use these resources:

```markdown
---
name: database-migrations
description: 'Guide for creating safe database migrations. Use when asked to modify database schema or create migrations.'
---

When creating database migrations, follow this process:

1. Run `./scripts/check-schema.sh` to validate current state
2. Create a new migration file following the naming convention: `YYYYMMDD_description.sql`
3. Always include a rollback section
4. Test the migration against a local database before committing
```

### Skills vs Instructions vs Agents

| Feature | Instructions | Skills | Custom Agents |
|---------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| When loaded | Always (matching file patterns) | Automatically when relevant | When explicitly selected |
| Best for | Coding standards, style guides | Specialized task guidance | Role-based personas |
| Can include scripts | No | Yes | No (but can reference skills) |
| Scope | File-pattern based | Task-based | Session-wide |

> **Tip**: Browse the [Skills Directory](/skills/) for ready-to-use skills you can add to your repository. Each skill includes a `SKILL.md` and any bundled assets needed.

## Leveraging Community Resources

This repository provides a curated collection of agents, skills, and hooks designed for the coding agent. Here's how to use them:

### Adding Agents from This Repo

1. Browse the [Agents Directory](/agents/) for agents matching your needs
2. Copy the `.agent.md` file into your repository's `.github/agents/` directory
3. The agent will be available in the dropdown when assigning work to the coding agent

### Adding Skills from This Repo

1. Browse the [Skills Directory](/skills/) for specialized skills
2. Copy the entire skill folder into your repository's `.github/skills/` directory
3. The coding agent will automatically use the skill when it's relevant to a task

### Adding Hooks from This Repo

1. Browse the [Hooks Directory](/hooks/) for automation hooks
2. Copy the `hooks.json` content into a file in `.github/hooks/` in your repository
3. Copy any referenced scripts alongside it
4. The hooks will run automatically during coding agent sessions

> **Example workflow**: Combine a `test-specialist` agent with a `database-migrations` skill and a linting hook. Assign an issue to the coding agent using the test-specialist agent — it will automatically pick up the migrations skill when relevant, and the hook ensures all code is formatted before completion.

## Hooks and the Coding Agent

Hooks are especially valuable with the coding agent because they provide deterministic guardrails for autonomous work:

- **`preToolUse`**: Approve or deny tool executions — block dangerous commands and enforce security policies
- **`postToolUse`**: Format code, run linters, and validate changes after edits
- **`agentStop`**: Run final checks (e.g., full lint pass) when the agent finishes responding
- **`sessionStart`**: Log the start of autonomous sessions for governance
- **`sessionEnd`**: Send notifications when the agent finishes

See [Automating with Hooks](../learning-hub/automating-with-hooks/) for configuration details.

## Best Practices

### Setting Up for Success

- **Invest in `copilot-setup-steps.yml`**: A reliable setup means the agent can build and test confidently. If tests are flaky, the agent will struggle.
- **Add comprehensive instructions**: The agent reads your `.github/instructions/` files. The more context you provide about patterns and conventions, the better the output.
- **Create skills for repeatable tasks**: If your team frequently does a specific type of work (migrations, API endpoints, test suites), create a skill with step-by-step guidance the agent can follow automatically.
- **Use custom agents for specialized roles**: Create focused agent profiles for different types of work — a security reviewer, a test specialist, or an infrastructure expert.
- **Define hooks for formatting**: Hooks ensure the agent's code meets your style requirements automatically, reducing review friction.

### Choosing the Right Tasks

The coding agent excels at:
- ✅ Well-defined feature implementations with clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Bug fixes with reproducible steps
- ✅ Adding tests to existing code
- ✅ Refactoring with specific goals (extract function, rename, etc.)
- ✅ Documentation updates based on code changes

It's less suited for:
- ❌ Ambiguous design decisions that need team discussion
- ❌ Large architectural changes spanning many files
- ❌ Tasks requiring access to external systems not in the dev environment
- ❌ Performance optimization without clear metrics

### Security Considerations

- The coding agent works in an isolated environment—it can't access your local machine
- It can only modify code in its branch—it can't push to main or deploy
- All changes go through PR review before merging
- Use hooks to enforce security scanning on every commit
- Scope repository permissions appropriately

## Common Questions

**Q: How long does the coding agent take?**

A: Typically 5–30 minutes depending on the complexity of the task and the size of the codebase. You'll receive a notification when the PR is ready.

**Q: Can I use the coding agent with private repositories?**

A: Yes. The coding agent works with both public and private repositories where GitHub Copilot is enabled.

**Q: What if the agent gets stuck?**

A: The agent has built-in timeouts. If it can't make progress, it will open a PR with what it has and explain what it couldn't resolve. You can then comment with guidance or take over manually.

**Q: Can I assign multiple issues at once?**

A: Yes. The coding agent can work on multiple issues in parallel, each in its own branch. Use Mission Control on GitHub.com to track all active agent sessions.

**Q: Does the coding agent use my custom agents and skills?**

A: Yes. You can specify which agent to use when assigning work — the coding agent adopts that agent's persona, tools, and guardrails. Skills are loaded automatically when the agent determines they're relevant to the task, based on the skill's description.
