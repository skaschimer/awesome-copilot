It will use your fully researched ideas or build new research if not already provided.\n\n`task-planner` will produce three (3) files that will be used by `task-implementation.instructions.md`.\n\n* `.copilot-tracking/plan/*-plan.instructions.md`\n\n  * A newly generated instructions file that has the plan as a checklist of Phases and Tasks.\n* `.copilot-tracking/details/*-details.md`\n\n  * The details for the implementation, the plan file refers to this file for specific details (important if you have a big plan).\n* `.copilot-tracking/prompts/implement-*.prompt.md`\n\n  * A newly generated prompt file that will create a `.copilot-tracking/changes/*-changes.md` file and proceed to implement the changes.\n\nContinue to use `task-planner` to iterate on the plan until you have exactly what you want done to your codebase."

Additionally, you can use `taskStop=true` to have Copilot stop after every Task implementation for finer detail control.\n\nTo use these generated instructions and prompts, you'll need to update your `settings.json` accordingly:\n\n```json\n    \"chat.instructionsFilesLocations\": {\n        // Existing instructions folders...\n        \".copilot-tracking/plans\": true\n    },\n    \"chat.promptFilesLocations\": {\n        // Existing prompts folders...\n        \".copilot-tracking/prompts\": true\n    },\n```"
