      The Orchestrator is the coordination hub that coordinates multi-agent workflows, delegates tasks via runSubagent, and synthesizes results. It does not execute tasks directly but manages the overall workflow.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Coordinating complex multi-agent workflows
      - Managing task delegation and parallel execution
      - Synthesizing results from multiple agents
      - Maintaining plan.yaml state

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Start with the Orchestrator for any complex project
      - Provide clear goals and constraints
      - Review the plan.yaml before execution
      - Use the walkthrough summaries to track progress

    kind: agent

      recommended

      The Researcher gathers codebase context, identifies relevant files/patterns, and returns structured findings. It is typically invoked by the Orchestrator with a specific focus area.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Understanding codebase structure and patterns
      - Identifying relevant files for a specific feature
      - Gathering context before making changes
      - Researching technical dependencies

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Specify a clear focus area or question
      - Provide context about what you're trying to achieve
      - Use multiple Researchers in parallel for different areas

  - path: agents/gem-planner.agent.md
    kind: agent
    usage: |
      recommended

      The Planner creates DAG-based plans with pre-mortem analysis, presents for approval, and iterates on feedback. It synthesizes research findings into a structured plan.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Breaking down complex goals into atomic tasks
      - Creating task dependencies (DAG)
      - Running pre-mortem analysis to identify risks
      - Getting approval before execution

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Provide clear research findings from the Researcher
      - Review the plan carefully before approving
      - Ask for iterations if the plan is not optimal
      - Use the plan_review tool for collaborative planning

  - path: agents/gem-implementer.agent.md
    kind: agent
    usage: |
      recommended

      The Implementer executes TDD code changes, ensures verification, and maintains quality. It follows strict TDD discipline with verification commands.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Implementing features with TDD discipline
      - Writing tests first, then code
      - Ensuring verification commands pass
      - Maintaining code quality

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Always provide verification commands
      - Follow TDD: red, green, refactor
      - Check get_errors after every edit
      - Keep changes minimal and focused

  - path: agents/gem-chrome-tester.agent.md
    kind: agent
    usage: |
      optional

      The Chrome Tester automates browser testing and UI/UX validation via Chrome DevTools. It requires Chrome DevTools MCP server.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Automated browser testing
      - UI/UX validation
      - Capturing screenshots and snapshots
      - Testing web applications

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Have Chrome DevTools MCP server installed
      - Provide clear test scenarios
      - Use snapshots for debugging
      - Test on different viewports

  - path: agents/gem-devops.agent.md
    kind: agent
    usage: |
      optional

      The DevOps agent manages containers, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure deployment. It handles infrastructure as code and deployment automation.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Setting up CI/CD pipelines
      - Managing containers (Docker, Kubernetes)
      - Infrastructure deployment
      - DevOps automation

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Provide clear infrastructure requirements
      - Use IaC best practices
      - Test pipelines locally
      - Document deployment processes

  - path: agents/gem-reviewer.agent.md
    kind: agent
    usage: |
      recommended

      The Reviewer is a security gatekeeper for critical tasks. It applies OWASP scanning, secrets detection, and compliance verification.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Security code reviews
      - OWASP Top 10 scanning
      - Secrets and PII detection
      - Compliance verification

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Use for all critical security changes
      - Review findings carefully
      - Address all security issues
      - Keep documentation updated

  - path: agents/gem-documentation-writer.agent.md
    kind: agent
    usage: |
      optional

      The Documentation Writer generates technical docs, diagrams, and maintains code-documentation parity.

      This agent is ideal for:
      - Generating technical documentation
      - Creating diagrams
      - Keeping docs in sync with code
      - API documentation

      To get the best results, consider:
      - Provide clear context and requirements
      - Review generated docs for accuracy
      - Update docs with code changes
      - Use consistent documentation style
