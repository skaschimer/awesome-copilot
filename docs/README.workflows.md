# ⚡ Agentic Workflows

[Agentic Workflows](https://github.github.com/gh-aw) are AI-powered repository automations that run coding agents in GitHub Actions. Defined in markdown with natural language instructions, they enable event-triggered and scheduled automation with built-in guardrails and security-first design.
